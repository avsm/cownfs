      Copy-on-write NFS server
    </div>

<p>I wrote a copy-on-write NFS daemon for use with the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xeno/">XenoServers</a> project. It's a general purpose userspace NFS daemon with the ability to dynamically stack file hierarchies over each other. Different layers can be configured as writable or as read-only, and in the latter case changes are made to a writable overlay in a copy-on-write fashion.</p>
<p>Some more information is available in a <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/papers/2004-deploy-worlds.pdf">paper from WORLDS'04</a> (PDF format).</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>A simple example illustrates the basic idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install a pristine Linux kernel source tree in <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt></li>
<li>Create an empty directory <tt>/home/russ/testpatches</tt></li>
<li>Start <tt>cownfsd</tt> with <tt>/home/russ/testpatches</tt> as the root exported directory and mount it at <tt>/mnt/cow</tt></li>
<li>Note: the path you give to <tt>mount</tt> is relative to the path you specify to <tt>cownfsd</tt>, so in this example I would have issued these two commands, where <tt>localhost:/</tt> refers to the root exported directory (<tt>/home/russ/testpatches</tt>) and <tt>/mnt/cow</tt> is the mount point:
<ol>
<li><tt>cownfsd /home/russ/testpatches &amp;</tt></li>
<li><tt>mount -t nfs localhost:/ /mnt/cow</tt></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Create a subdirectory <tt>/home/russ/testpatches/linux1</tt></li>
<li>Create a file called <tt>.mount</tt> in the <tt>linux1</tt> directory with the single line:<br><tt>read "/usr/src/linux"</tt></li>
<li>The directory <tt>/mnt/cow/linux1</tt> is immediately populated with the complete contents of the <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt> directory.</li>
<li>Make changes within <tt>/mnt/cow/linux1</tt>, say running <tt>make&nbsp;config</tt></li>
<li>All new and modified files are updated in a sparsely created directory structure rooted at <tt>/home/russ/testpatches/linux1</tt>. A deleted file <em>foo</em> is marked by the creation of an empty file called <em>.~foo</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, you could create a new directory called <tt>/home/russ/testpatches/linux2</tt> which would be visible as <tt>/mnt/cow/linux2</tt> and could mount the same read-only base image (<tt>/usr/src/linux</tt>). Changes made in the two directories are completely isolated from each other.</p>
<p>This was written originally for use with <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/index.html">Xen</a>. Multiple domains can use overlays to create custom versions of a common root filesystem, which they can then use for booting. This lets multiple concurrent domains share the same root image by booting over NFS with customized overlays.</p>
<h2>Basic rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mounts can be many levels deep, and each layer can be read-only or writable</li>
<li>The top layer must always be writable (though file permissions may still prevent writes from succeeding), and files in higher levels <em>mask</em> files in lower levels.</li>
<li>A file called <tt>.~</tt><em>name</em> in a higher level hides a file called <em>name</em> in a lower level.</li>
<li>Every file is <em>visible</em> from exactly one layer (copy-on-write works at the whole-file level)</li>
<li>If the visible instance of a file is in a writeable layer, then all writes are made directly to it. If the visible layer is readonly, then the first write to the file triggers a copy to the top level which then becomes the visible instance of the file.</li>
<li>New files are always created in the top writable directory</li>
<li>Entries in <tt>.mount</tt> files are one per line. A <tt>.mount</tt> file can exist in any directory, and affects all subdirectories recursively.</li>
<li><tt>.mount</tt> file entries can be one of three types:
<ol>
<li><tt>read "</tt><em>/readonly/path</em><tt>"</tt></li>
<li><tt>write "</tt><em>/writeable/path</em><tt>"</tt></li>
<li><tt>replace "</tt><em>/writable/path</em><tt>"</tt></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Later entries in a <tt>.mount</tt> file are layered on top of earlier entries. The directory containing the <tt>.mount</tt> file is always layered on top as writeable, except when the last entry uses <tt>replace</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common problems</h2>
<p>The most common problem people have reported to me is a failure to mount properly. The main symptom is a bunch of errors having to do with stale file handles showing up either at mount time or immediately after.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is usually to kill any other <tt>mountd</tt> processes running on the same machine. <tt>cownfsd</tt> provides its own Mount service, and the NFS service only works with it.</p>
<p>Mount and NFS services are closely tied together (NFSv4 combines them into a single service). The Mount service returns a file handle identifying the root directory of the mount point, which is later passed to the NFS service as a reference point for future operations. The structure of the file handle is unique to a particular NFS implementation so the services responding to Mount and NFS requests must be matched. In particular, the standard kernel NFS implementation uses a file's <tt>inode</tt> number as the main part of its file handle, which doesn't really work with a userspace daemon like <tt>cownfsd</tt>.</p>
<p>The version problem also manifests itself when booting over an NFS-mounted file system (a very useful thing to do with <tt>cownfsd</tt> in a Xen environment). If you are planning to boot Linux from a <tt>cownfsd</tt> volume, be sure to add <tt>,v3</tt> to the end of the <tt>nfsroot</tt> line in your boot parameter list.</p>
<h2>Getting CoWNFSd</h2>
<p>The server is written in OCaml and the source is available under the GPL. It is currently housed on github, after being converted from an old Bazaar/Arch repository.</p>
